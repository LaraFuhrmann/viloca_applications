This project is an application of the tool VILOCA to longitudinal samples of a patient pre-treatment.
The samples were taken from the publication Abrahams et al. (2019), Science translational medicine 11.513 (DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aaw5589)


No samples post treatment (post treatment viral load is too low??)
""
Plasma-derived viral RNA genomes were sequenced at multiple time points before ART [on average every 6 months starting during acute/early infection (fig. S1)], and these evolving sequences were compared to the sequences of the replication-competent OGVs from QVOAs using samples taken while on therapy (the latent reservoir).""


We choose to analyse the samples of patient CAP217.


CAP217_4390 : SRR9588785 (358 weeks post-infection)

CAP217_2000  SRR9588770 (10 weeks post-infection )

CAP217_3160   SRR9588772 (60 weeks post-infection )

CAP217_4200   SRR9588774 (112 weeks post-infection)

CAP217_4180  SRR9588775  (87 weeks post-infection)
