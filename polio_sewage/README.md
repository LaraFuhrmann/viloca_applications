In this project we are analysis sewage samples from Pakistan.

We are only interested in the polioviruses.

We first run our method on ES-6 ERR4033233 since here fraction of poliovirus reads is rather high (--> compare to figure 3)
Then the goal is to see which different polio strains are in the sample (--> compare to figure 5)

We only analyse the VP1-region since this one is need to differentiate wildtype polio and the vaccine derived strain.

As reference sequence for alignment and variant calling we use: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY184219
